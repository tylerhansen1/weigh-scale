# **Junior design weigh scale project**


in this project my team and I used a series of ICs to create a strain gauge weigh scale capable of measuring masses accurately from 0-1000g. some of the components that we used include:

- pic24 Microcontroller
- Low dropout voltage regulators  (3.3v & +4.5v)
- charge pump (-4.5v)
- instrumentation amplifier
- 24 bit adc (uses i2c)

the C code in this repository is the microcontroller firmware.
